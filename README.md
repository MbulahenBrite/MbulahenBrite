## ✨ What I'm Currently Up To: AWS re/Start

I'm currently enrolled in AWS re/Start, which is a **free, global training program** that helps unemployed or underemployed individuals like me gain the skills needed for entry-level cloud computing careers. It's been an incredible journey combining technical training (Linux, Python, AWS core services) with professional skills like resume building and interview preparation.

### Why I Joined This Program

I joined to advance my cloud engineering skills and get hands-on with technologies like **EC2**, **S3**, **RDS**, **Lambda**, **VPC**, **IAM**, **Linux**, **Python**, **Networking**, and **Databases**. I was really looking to gain more practical experience with AWS services, and this program has delivered that in spades.

### My Key Lessons and Experiences

It's been a fun experience, especially diving into **Linux**! With consistency, persistence, and attention to detail, I've found that learning new skills becomes not just possible, but genuinely enjoyable. The program gave me an opportunity to re-energize and elevate my **Teamwork skills**, **research abilities**, and my **will to succeed**—both as part of a team and as an individual contributor in an organization.

### What the Program Includes

| Category | Key Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Skills** | I'm gaining hands-on experience with fundamental IT and AWS cloud technologies through scenario-based exercises and labs. Topics include **Linux, networking, security, Python, and core AWS services.** |
| **Professional Skills** | The curriculum also focuses on "soft skills" that are crucial for a tech career, such as **communication, teamwork, time management, resume writing, and interview coaching.** |

## AWS Core Services I've Been Experimenting With

### Compute 💻

**Compute** is basically the act of processing data and running code or applications. It matters because this is where your application logic lives and breathes.

* **Examples I've worked with:** **EC2** (Virtual Servers) and **Lambda** (Serverless Functions).

### Networking 🌐

**Networking** provides the foundation to securely isolate and connect your cloud resources. It ensures your services can talk to each other and the internet properly.

* **Examples I've used:** **VPC** (Isolated Private Network) and **Route 53** (Domain Name System/DNS).

### Storage 💾

**Storage** is where your data, files, and backups live. AWS offers different types depending on what you need in terms of speed, durability, and access patterns.

* **Examples I've explored:** **S3** (Object Storage for files/backups), I had an opportunity to experiment with S3 storage classes like S3 Infrequent Access, S3 Intelligent-tiering, S3 Glacier(instant, flexible & Deep Archive)
*  And also with **EBS** (Block Storage for EC2 servers), where I was exposed to EBS volume types like Solid State-Backed (SSD) EBS (*gp3*-General Purpose3-For most general workloads, *io2*-Provisioned IOPS-For High performance mission critical apps) and HARD-DRIVE Backed ( *st1*-Throughput Optimised HDD  for throughput intensive frequently accessed data & *sc1* Cold HDD-For infrequently accessed data)

### Databases 🗄️

**Databases** are essential for organising, storing, and retrieving structured data for your applications. I've been working with both relational and NoSQL options.

* **Examples I've implemented:** **RDS** (Managed Relational Databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL) and **DynamoDB** (NoSQL Key-Value Database).

### Security 🔒

**Security** in AWS follows a shared responsibility model, focusing on protecting data, accounts, and services. I've learned this is absolutely critical.

* **Key Focus:** **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) uses **roles** and **policies** to control who can access which resources, along with basic data **encryption**.
